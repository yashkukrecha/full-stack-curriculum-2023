# Homework
Now that you have created your resume in HTML, its time to add some styles so that it doesn't look like a website straight from the 1990s (just kidding :)).

While we dont have any strict requirements for this assignment, as there are many ways to design a resume, we would like to challenge y'all to make your resume look like the following.

## Suggestions
- Add some padding to your resume to make it look centered (or use flexbox).
- Try downloading/importing a new font for your resume.
- Try changing the font size/style for certain text to make them stand out (ie. bold the section headers).
- Add colors!
- For a challenge, you can look into animations and responsiveness
